# AMLS-GraphDatabase
Originally created by Teresa Le during the months of April, May, and June 2024.

### Motivation (in a few bullet-points):
- Document the journey toward implementing a touchless data management system, exploring the possibility of using a graph database.
- Determine if a graph database can be used in academic, early development, and R&D settings.
- Teach lab members about Neo4j and the nuances involved with graph databases.
- Create a place to upload all related code for quick and easy adaptation by the lab in the future.
