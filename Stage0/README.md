# Stage 0: Choosing the most suitable provider for practice
## **Winner: Neo4j**

The choice was between **Neo4j** and **Amazon Neptune**.

Neo4j was the provider of choice for David Fenning's group and the first company that shows up when you google draph databases. Amazon Neptune is a service available through AWS and was frequently mentioned by the company contracted in 2024 to help AMLS build a data management system.

For the purposes of *learning* how to create a graph database for the first time, Neo4j was the clear choice because of these reasons:
1. It was the most well-known and well-established provider of a graph database at the time.
2. As a result, there existed extensive documentation as well as user-friendly tutorials.
3. At the time, Neo4j allowed for the creation of an *INDEFINITELY FREE* AuraDB cloud database which is limited in storage capacity, number of nodes, and number of relationships.
4. Amazon Neptune, on the other hand, was locked behind an AWS account and the free version was limited to a 1-month free trial.
