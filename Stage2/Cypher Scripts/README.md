This folder contains all of the cypher scripts written during Stage 2 of the Neo4j Graph Database Exploration
## To Run These Scripts:
0. Inside the script(s), fill in the links to the appropriate CSV files if left blank.
1. Download [Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/download/)
2. Create and start a local database using Neo4j Desktop as demonstrated in this [video](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/l4vekjhoiz3oqql8fozh0/Neo4jDesktop.mov?rlkey=30asjugj3uq7nz61bqn5k7zvg&e=1&dl=0).
    - Or Start an AuraDB cloud database, ensure that it is running, and connect to it using Neo4j Desktop.
3. Open Neo4j Browser from the **Graph Apps** tab in Neo4j Desktop.
4. Copy and paste the code into a Neo4j Browser cell and press run.
    - Alternatively, you can upload the code into the Neo4j Desktop project space, but I find this method unreliable. The code does not upload correctly.
