# Stage 2: Using Neo4j Desktop to run advanced queries
## 2.1: Introduction to Neo4j Desktop
[Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/download/) is an application that you have to download. Aside from that, it is a more advanced and capable version of the Neo4j Workshop. Some of its key features include:

- Access to tutorials and example projects
- Tools for managing separate projects
- The ability to create _local_ databases, which can be quickly deleted and recreated
- The ability to connect to cloud databases inside the application
- The option to Upload/Save CYPHER scripts for quick use
- In the Graph Apps Tab:
  - Neo4j Bloom (Same as the "Explore" Tab in the Neo4j Workshop)
  - Neo4j Browser (A more advanced version of the "Query" Tab in Neo4j Workshop)
  - Other apps I never used...
